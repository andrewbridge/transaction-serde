feat: add inspect, guess, and field mapper utilities

Add a new `utils` namespace with three utilities for working with unknown
bank export data:

- `utils.inspect(input)` - Parse CSV/JSON and return a uniform report with
  field names, sample records, and record count. Optionally attempts to
  parse dates and numbers in the sample.

- `utils.guess(fields, options)` - Use heuristics to guess field mappings
  from header names. Matches common patterns like "Transaction Date",
  "Amount", "Merchant", etc. with high/medium confidence levels.
  Optionally boosts confidence based on sample value analysis.

- `utils.createFieldMapper(mapping)` - Create a map function compatible
  with the CSV deserializer from a simple field mapping configuration.
  Supports both string mappings and custom transform functions.

These utilities enable a workflow for handling unknown bank exports:
1. Inspect the data to see its structure
2. Guess field mappings from headers
3. Review/adjust the mapping
4. Create a mapper and parse

Also adds shared parsing utilities in src/utilities/parse.ts for
CSV/JSON parsing that can be reused by deserializers.

Includes comprehensive tests and documentation updates.
